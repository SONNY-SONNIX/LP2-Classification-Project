## Project Description
Customer attrition is a prevalent problem for many businesses, resulting in large financial losses. Customer churn or attrition in this project refers to the percentage of consumers that discontinue using a company’s product or service within a specified time frame. Understanding the primary causes of customer churn can assist businesses in developing effective retention strategies to reduce customer attrition and boost revenue. I propose to investigate how firms such as Vodafone Group can gain insights into customer behavior and factors that contribute to churn by analyzing historical customer data and applying predictive analytics. This enables the organization to take proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and improve overall customer satisfaction.

This project’s dataset includes information about users’ demographics, service usage, and billing information. I will use this dataset to conduct exploratory data analysis in order to find patterns and trends linked to customer attrition. I will next use machine learning techniques to create a predictive model that will estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving the firm.

## Setup

=======
Our project’s objectives are to:

1. Examine and present the data to discover patterns and trends in customer attrition.

2. Using machine learning methods, develop a prediction model to anticipate client attrition.

3. Identify the key churn indicators, such as client demographics, service usage, and billing data.

4. Develop retention strategies to help reduce client turnover while enhancing consumer loyalty.

5. Evaluate the success of retention efforts and make modifications based on the model’s results.

The project’s findings aim at helping Vodafone better understand customer churn and execute effective retention tactics to reduce customer attrition and improve revenue.
